# Project Description
The PyDentity Wallet is a Progressive Web Application for providing [acapy](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/acapy) access to mobile wallet features.

The wallet provides a frontend for a multitenant acapy instance.

The app works with iOS and Android and allows users to easily manage an acapy subwallet.

Whenver possible, it uses existing open standards from W3C, IETF, DIF, and other open standards groups.
